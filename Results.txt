Question 1:
    helloA - 17104 Bytes
    helloA.c - 172 Bytes
    helloA.o - 3648 Bytes

Question 2:
    helloB - 17104 Bytes
    helloB.c - 200 Bytes
    helloB.o - 3648 Bytes

    helloB.c is 28 bytes larger than helloA.c.

Question 3:
    helloB.o is the exact same size as helloA.o.

Question 4:
    helloA and helloB are also the exact same size.

Question 5:
    The macro statement makes the source c file slightly larger,
    however it still performs the same operation as helloA.

Question 6:
    helloC - 17352 Bytes
    helloC.c - 200 Bytes
    helloC.o - 3928 Bytes

    helloC.c is the same size as helloB.c, and 28 bytes larger than helloA.helloC

Question 7:
    helloC.o is 280 bytes larger than both helloA.o and helloB.o.

Question 8:
    helloC is 248 bytes larger than both helloA and helloB

Question 9:
    Because the string that is being printed is stored as a variable in memory, the machine code
    needs to perform the instructions to save the string to memory, which makes the executable slightly larger.
